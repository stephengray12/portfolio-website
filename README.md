Overview
Hi, I’m Stephen Gray — a Computer Science junior at UA Little Rock and a building automation engineer. I program BAS controllers for customers like Walmart HQ, UAMS, Baptist Health, Raytheon, and Westrock Coffee. I’m transitioning into software engineering and love turning real-world problems into clean, reliable code.

Looking for: entry-level Software Engineer role or SWE internship — and a mentor to guide my coding journey.
